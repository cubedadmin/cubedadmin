- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cubedadmin
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in system administration, python, and mathematics.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about linux (using Pop!_os), virtual machines, concepts of programming, and discrete math.
- âš¡ Fun fact: In my spare time, I love reading, playing basketball, watching anime, and being with friends and family.
